# Capstone-Project-Space-Shooter
Thank you for downloading downloading Halfway to Mars!
This game is my capstone project for my game development course, created by me,
David F. The game itself is a bullet hell mono-directional arcade style space
shooter. Earth has been attacked by evil Martians and our hero (you) must fight
off waves of their fighters until they are all defeated. The game itself is
meant to be difficult, so please be patient, and enjoy the ride.

Controls:
Move Up - W/ArrowKey-up
Move Down - S/ArrowKey-down
Move Right - D/ArrowKey-Right
Move Left - A/ArrowKey-Left
Space (Tap OR Hold) - Shoot Main Gun
R - Reload Main Gun (once out of bullets ship will auto reload)
Escape - Pause/Resume
(SECRET DEV CONTROLS):
These are included in case the game is too hard for the grader or any players.
Press the 'B' button to heal your ship for half of its health. This was implemented
originally for me to be able to cheat through levels quickly for testing purposes.
The 'enter' button also does 25 damage to your own ship, which was also created
for testing purposes. In any official release of the game, these functionalities
would be removed.

Rules:
Waves of ships will spawn that move at random with consistent fire rates. Players
have three lives per level, and must destroy the enemy ships by shooting them (space bar)
with their weapons. Once all the waves on a level have been defeated, you can move
onto the next level. Enemy ships take 5 shots to destroy, as does the player's
ship. Player's can move anywhere within the screen bounds not covered by the UI,
and there is no collision with enemy ships. Good Luck!

Known Bugs/Defects:
when the player is respawning, enemy bullets can and will collide and destroy
themselves where the player had previously died. You can also spawn and immediately
take damage to oncoming enemy bullets without being able to move, which lends itself
to not feeling great.

Alex also helped debug many of my issues throughout development.  All sound effects, visuals, sprites, and backgrounds were acquired for free from the Unity Asset Store.
